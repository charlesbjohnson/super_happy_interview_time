      # Design an algorithm that takes a set of files containing stock trades
      # sorted by increasing trade times, and writes a single file containing
      # the trades appearing in the individual files sorted in the same order.
      # The algorithm should use very little RAM, ideally of the order of a few
      # kilobytes.
      #
      # This can be accomplished with an n-way merge or with a heap.
      # In either case, we would keep the memory usage low by not reading
      # the entire files into memory.
      #
      # In the case of the n-way merge, we would use a buffered read from
      # each file (the size of the buffer would depend on the amount of files
      # we would need to have open), pick the minimum at each merge, and perform
      # a buffered write for every minimum found. The main inefficiency would
      # come from potentially having too many files to compare from. For example,
      # if there are 500 files, then we are performing a 500-way merge. Once we
      # find the minimum for that merge we would then backfill from the file from
      # which that minimum came to prepare for the next merge. However, the next
      # merge would then be comparing the same 499 entries from the previous merge.
      #
      # In the case of a heap, we would still use buffered reads and buffered writes
      # instead of reading entire files at a time, but we could also avoid
      # the redundant comparisons inherent to the n-way merge. We would read an entry
      # from each file into the heap, pop the minimum into a file, then backfill into
      # the heap another entry from the file in which a minimum just came. The
      # advantage here is that once we go to find the minimum again, we aren't
      # redundantly comparing every element to each other element because the constructed
      # heap has already ordered the previous elements in a nearly-sorted manner.
