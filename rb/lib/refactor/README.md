# `refactor`

This is a tool that was used to restructure the solutions that were imported from
a previous repository.

The structure and style used in that repository is slightly different than what
is being used here, but it is different enough that I didn't want to hand edit
some 100+ files.

Instead, I used the [`parser`][0] gem to refactor and modify the old code in an automated way.
The code here are the specific modifications that were used.
