# Threads and Locks

I have skipped this chapter because I do not feel that it is relevant.
Concurrency has become a very important issue within the past few years
and several new technologies have been created (from scratch sometimes)
specifically to address it. Meanwhile, the problems in this chapter tend to
focus on a concurrency technique that I feel has become outmoded and is
so unsatisfactory that it has actually been a primary catalyst for a majority
of the recent developments in concurrency.

So that's why there's nothing here. That and the whole thing about the chapter
being in Java.
