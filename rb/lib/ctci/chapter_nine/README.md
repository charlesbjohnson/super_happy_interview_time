# Recursion and Dynamic Programming

I've skipped a number of problems that really stumped me, even after having
taken a quick glance at the solutions for ideas. They are:

11. boolean expression parentheses placement

Many of the problems in this chapter (and in others) stumped me but made
perfect sense after looking at the solution. I've been including code for
those problems (even though it feels like cheating) because I understand them.
Problems that continue to stump me, even in light of the solution's approach, I
will omit.
