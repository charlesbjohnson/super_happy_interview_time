# Object-Oriented Design

I've skipped the problems that I felt aren't particularly useful. They are:

3. musical jukebox
4. parking lot
5. online book reader
7. chat server
9. file system

I originally did some of these problems but decided to remove them since
I don't feel like they have any point or specific technique to be learned.

The only important insight to be gleaned from them is that you cannot design
the programs that the author suggests without feedback or requirements. If
you build something without having at least some specific requirements then you
have no way of verifying correct behavior because there is nothing to verify
against in the first place.

So if you are asked these questions you have to nail down some requirements
before you write any code.

This was particularly evident because I was trying to write tests before doing
anything but I really struggled because I had nothing to test and when I
came up with specs on my own it was impossible to know when they were enough
or if I had gone too far.

I've skipped problem 10 since I've already done it under
`data_structures/hash_map`
